#Sentiment Analysis Model Using Python
Sentiment analysis is one of the most common NLP(Natural Language Processing) problems. The goal is to analyze a text and predict whether the underlying sentiment is positive, negative or neutral. What can you use it for? measure sentiment of customer support tickets, survey responses, social media, and movie reviews! 

In this notebook we will build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews. A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.  

We will use the Stanford Large Movie Reviews dataset for training our model. The dataset is compiled from a collection of 50,000 reviews from IMDB.

##About the project
This project is focused on analysing the movie reviews and determining if they are positive or negative using Natural Language Processing(NLP).
